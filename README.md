# Image-Forensics-Using-CNN

# Image Forensics Project

This repository contains a deep learning model and two Jupyter notebooks for image forensics training and prediction.

## Project Overview

(Image forensics prediction overview)

## Directory Structure

- `model/`: Contains the trained models.
  - `model/`: Contains `image_forensics_model.keras`. (too big to commit)
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for training and prediction.
  - `Image_Forensics_Training.ipynb`: Notebook for training the image forensics model.
  - `Image_Forensics_Prediction.ipynb`: Notebook for making predictions using the trained model.
- `data/`: Directory for datasets (either include small sample data or instructions to download).
  - `casia/`: Place the CASIA datasets here (`CASIA1` and `CASIA2`).
